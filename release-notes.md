# Release notes

## What's new

* Ban time is now editable and applies to individual IP addresses instead of globally (which makes much more sense).

## Fixes

* Fixed a bug with the settings page which caused the display of default/last saved settings everytime the page was reloaded, even though the values were actually being stored in the configuration file and applied.

## Docs

* Added entry for ban time.
